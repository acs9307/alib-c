----Version 1.5.4----
RBuff:
	NEW!
	Note that this is in a beta stage and may be lacking several useful functions.

----Version 1.5.3----
StrParser:
	NEW!

StrRef:
	NEW!

----Version 1.5.2----
Fixed '.gitignore' so changes in sources directory would not be ignored, only source files in the main directory should be ignored.

alib_math:
	NEW!

----version 1.5.1----
Modified the source files so they now include directly from the includes folder, thus eliminating the need to copy header files to main directory.
Source files still have to be copied to the main directory for compilation.  This is by design so that we don't have to have different source files for Arduino (source files won't be found unless they are in the main directory :S).

Added limited support for Arduino environment.  Only a small subset of source files are usable due to missing libraries in Arduino.  Later I will try make more code compatible with Arduino.

alib_string:
	Changed 'itoa()', 'uitoa()', and 'ftoa()' to have an '_alloc' at the end of the name because 'stdlib.h' evidently already defines an 'itoa()' that I didn't know about previously.

alib_types:
	Changed 'bool' and 'byte' to be typedefs instead of defines.

----version 1.5.0----
Many changes have been made.  Have been slowly working on this library over time and forgot to keep up with the git as I couldn't keep the files in the same folder format as this git project due to environmental constraints, my apologies.

Most of the things fixed were bugs, however some platform compliance related code was also added for Arduino compilers.  Hopefully will eventually port all code to also be usable with Arduino directly.

alib_error:
	Added 'ALIB_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND'.
alib_string:
	Bug fixes.
	Added more platform compliance, specifically Arduino.
alib_time:
	Bug fixes.
alib_types:
	Bug fixes.
	Added platform compliences.
BinaryBuffer:
	Bug fixes.
DList:
	Bug fixes.
DListItem:
	Bug fixes.
Endianess:
	NEW!
Timer:
	Bug fixes.
	

----Version 1.4.2----
alib_proc:
	Modified comparison of strings.  Originally would compare the entire file to the provided strings, now it only compares the first argument in the file.
	'get_proc_pids()' now clears the 'fbuff' buffer so as to make Valgrind happy.

proc_waiter:
	Removed shrinking of ArrayList, was having problems with allocation and reallocation of memory in multi-threaded environment, seems to be some race conditions remaining in ArrayList.  Mainly removed because there is no real point in reallocating memory so much.
	The array list now starts with a capacity of 0 upon allocation of globals. 
	Made 'proc_waiter_stop_wait()' lower the THREAD_IS_RUNNING flag after it has been joined as we may cancel the thread.

----Version 1.4.1----
alib_string:
	Fixed 'str_match()' so that it does not compare past the end of the string.  Did not have any impact on runtime except for a wasted comparison, however it made Valgrind very angry.
	Added 'PTHREAD_CANCEL_*' definitions for android...thanks google.

ArrayList:
	Fixed bug where a start capacity of 0 could possibly set 'list' to non-null.
	Added check to ensure 'list' is allocated in 'newArrayList_ex()'. 

proc_waiter:
	Added 'proc_waiter_is_initialized()'.
	Fixed bug where calling 'proc_waiter_stop*()' could cause a segment fault if the process waiter had not been initialized. 
	Fixed bug with segment fault during 'free_proc_waiter()' when the process waiter was never initialized. 
	
String:
	Added 'String_append_file()'.

----Version 1.4.0----
alib_file:
	Added 'file_name_from_path()' and 'file_name_from_path_count()'. 
	
alib_string:
	Fixed bug with 'find_last_char_count()' where if the character after 'count' was the character being searched for, it would return that character after the end of the string count.

ArrayList:
	Simplified code and added 'ArrayList_expand()'.

BinaryBuffer:
	Added 'BinaryBuffer_append_file()'.

DList:
	Fixed bug when passing null pointer to 'DList_remove_item()'.

DListItem:
	Fixed bug with finding index in 'DListItem_index()'.  Was finding an index of one greater
		than actual index.

ErrorLogger:
	Fixed a bugs in 'ErrorLogger_log_error()' where mutex could be unlocked even if it wasn't locked.
	Fixed memory leak with json objects. 

ListItem:
	Added 'ListItem_extract_value()'.
	
proc_waiter:
	Modified 'free_proc_waiter()' call to use 'proc_waiter_stop_wait()' instead of 'proc_waiter_stop_now()'.  'proc_waiter_stop_now()' was causing memory to still be allocated, most likely by the child process not being cleanup, when 'free_proc_waiter()' was called just before applicaiton exit.
	Fixed a lot of issues with mutexing and added thread safe function calls.

TimerEvent:
	Moved 'initTimerEvent()' to be a protected function. This was the original intention.
	Modified arguments for 'initTimerEvent()' to take a Timer object instead of seconds and nano-seconds.  Now also takes 'refTimer' argument for referenced timers. 
	Bug fix with 'initTimerEvent()', now takes a double pointer to the TimerEvent object so that if it is deleted, the caller will know.
	Added 'TimerEvent_compare_least_remaining_time()'. 
	Added 'TimerEvent_compare_least_remaining_time_qsort_cb()'.

TimerEventHandler:
	Removed debug printing.
	Added 'TimerEventHandler_wakeup()'. 
	Added 'TimerEventHandler_extract_tsafe()'. 
	
ThreadedTimerEvent:
	Moved 'initThreadedTimerEvent()' to be a protected function.  This was the original intention. 
	Modified arguments for 'initThreadedTimerEvent()' to take a Timer object instead of seconds and nano-seconds.  Now also takes 'refTimer' argument for referenced timers. 
		Bug fix with 'initThreadedTimerEvent()', now takes a double pointer to the TimerEvent object so that if it is deleted, the caller will know.

----Version 1.3.1----
Though ZipIter classes have been added in this version, it is suggested to wait until they have
been completed as they were written in a hurry to serve an immediate need. 

alib_error:
	Added ALIB_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND

proc_waiter:
	Fixed potential infinate loop where if no child process existed, the waiting function 
		would wait until the thread was to be stopped.
	Added functionality so that sleeping is an option when no child process exists.  If 
		sleeping is not desired, the thread will wait on the waiter's condition. 
	Added 'proc_waiter_wakeup()' so that if the waiter is waiting for a child process, the user
		can wake it up without having to add a callback handler.

FdServer:
	Added checks to calls to 'close()' so that we don't close any bad file descriptors.
		This was mainly done to make Valgrind happy.

tcp_functions:
    Modified 'tcp_send_data_by_host()' to handle DNS addresses of hosts. 

zip:
	Added initializer for 'gzip' streams.
    Fixed bug with all 'tb (to buffer)' functions, now files larger than 64k don't have issues.

ZipIter:
	NEW!
	Currently a virtual class.
	BEWARE - Still being worked on.

ZipFileIter:
	NEW!
	BEWARE - Still being worked on.

----Version 1.3.0----
Modified function arguments to be const when possible/logical.

alib_error:
	Fixed unconventional naming of ALIB_FD_ERROR to be ALIB_FD_ERR.
	Added ALIB_STATE_ERR. 

alib_proc:
	NEW!

alib_types:
	Modified 'is_int()' to be more efficient. 

ArrayList:
	Added 'ArrayList_extract_array*()' functions.
	Added 'ArrayList_contains()' function;

DListItem:
	Modified 'DListItem_get_next_item()' and 'DListItem_get_prev_item()' so that they 
		check for null 'list' pointers before returning.

EpollPack:
	Modified so as to make Valgrind happy.  On construction, the epoll struct now has entire 
		struct cleared before usage.

TcpClient:
	Modified so that '_connect()' does not attempt to start the reading thread unless there is a 
		data in callback set.  The return code from '_connect()' will be returned by the function
		now.

TcpServer:
	Added 'pthread_mutex_t' and 'pthread_cond_t' members to object.
	Re-engineered the object to use conditions while waiting and made it safe to stop the object
		from within the callback functions.  Though 'safe' to free/delete the object from within
		the callback functions, be sure you don't delete the object from another thread, usually
		it should be deleted by the thread creating the object. 
	Added modification of the 'epoll_wait()' timeout value.  Default value is 1 second. 
	
ThreadedTimerEvent:
	Fixed bug where 'timer_loop' does not sleep.  Was using CLOCK_MONOTONIC time with
		'pthread_cond_timedwait()' when I needed to use CLOCK_REALTIME time. 

TimerEvent:
	Fixed bug where 'rang_parent_cb' was not set to NULL on construction.

TimerEventHandler:
	Fixed bug where 'timer_loop' does not sleep.  Was using CLOCK_MONOTONIC time with
		'pthread_cond_timedwait()' when I needed to use CLOCK_REALTIME time. 

----Version 1.2.1----
alib_time:
    Removed 'struct timespec' definition.

ComDataCheck:
	Fixed bug with 'ComDataCheck_append()' when old data has been processed.  Before if
		'ComDataCheck_process_buffered_data()' returned CDC_COMPLETE, 'ComDataCheck_append()'
		would return CDC_DATA_REMAINING, even if there was data waiting to be processed. 
	Fixed notes.
	Modified function arguments and return values to be const when possible and switched all 
		data pointers to be 'const void*' instead of 'unsigned char*'. 

TcpClient:
    Added check to ensure socket is open when calling 'newTcpClient_from_socket()'.
        If it is not open, then NULL will be returned.
    Fixed bug where TcpClient did not set 'thread_returning_cb' to NULL on construction.
    Added pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t to object so that there are no race conditions when calling 'TcpClient_start()' twice in quick succession, which may occure if a user calls 'TcpClient_start()' right after setting the data in callback. 
    Fixed 'TcpClient_read_thread_wait()' to use 'pthread_cond_wait()' instead of sleeping for 1 millisecond at a time. 
    
TcpServer:
	Modified function arguments to be const when possible and set raw data pointers to be 
		'const void*' where logical. 

----Version 1.2.0----
	Major version update, removed TimerLight and TimerBase and completely rewrote Timer.
		I must of been asleep when I wrote the original versions, extremely stupid design.

alib_time:
	Added several 'timespec_' functions for operations with 'struct timespec'. 
	Added definition for 'timespec_' (used in case the standard 'time.h' does not define it).

alib_types:
	Added convenience function pointer type 'pthread_proc'.

DList:
	Added a couple helper functions such as 'DList_get_begin()' and 'DList_get_end()'. 
	DList functions now return DListItem instead of ListItem. 
	Modified some method parameter types to be const. 
	Fixed notes. 
	
DListItem: 
	Modified some method parameter types to be const. 
	Fixed notes. 

flags:
    Changed flag pole functions into inline defines so that flag operations may be done atomically.
    Added FLAG_INIT and OBJECT_CALLBACK_STATE.

TcpClient:
    Added timeout socket option when reading from a socket.  This allows the 
        thread to be closed even when no data is received.  If no timeout has
        been set, then a default timeout of 1 second will be set.
    Added 'TcpClient_read_stop_async()' and 'TcpClient_read_thread_wait()'.  Both are now 
        used internally instead of 'TcpClient_read_stop()'.
    Added DNS lookup for hosts.  Now TcpClient's host may be set to a DNS host name instead
        of just an IP address.  

Timer: 
	COMPLETELY REDESIGNED.
	
TimerBase:
	REMOVED!
	
TimerEvent:
	NEW!

alib_sockets:
    Changed 'set_sock_non_block()' to a macro function, removed check of socket value.
    Added 'set_sock_recv_timeout()'.

ComDataCheck:
    Added 'ComDataCheck_recv_timeout()'.
    Modified 'ComDataCheck_recv()' so that it simply returns the value returned from 'ComDataCheck_append()'. 

TcpClient:
    Modified 'TcpClient_set_data_in_cb()' to start reading if a callback is provided and to stop reading if the callback is set to NULL.
    Moved main construction to 'newTcpClient_base()'.
    Added 'newTcpClient_connected()' so that a client can be built from an already connected socket.
    Added 'tc_thread_returning' and related setter functions.

TcpServer:
    Added 'ts_thread_returning_cb' and related setter functions.

----Version 1.1.1----
ComDataCheck:
	Added extended data.
	Now handles multiple packets sent in a single TCP packet by placing unrelated data in a seperate buffer.
		The user should call 'ComDataCheck_process_buffered_data()' if 'ComDataCheck_check()'
		or 'ComDataCheck_append()' return CDC_DATA_REMAINING. 

DList:
	Added '_lsafe()' functions, so that items can be removed from the list
		after iteration is complete. 

ListItem:
	Added 'removed' member, so that items may be marked for removal. 

TcpClient:
	Reverted back to Version 1.0.0 of file, for some reason could not connect using a host name. 

----Version 1.1.0----
Removed all SIZE_MAX and replaced with ULONG_MAX as some compilers do not include a definition 
for SIZE_MAX.

alib_error.h:
	Added ALIB_TIMEOUT.
	Added ALIB_FILE_FORMAT_ERR.
	Added ALIB_TCP_RECV_ERR.
    Added ALIB_FILE_NOT_FOUND.

BinaryBuffer:
	Fixed but with inserting data at second to last position in buffer. 

ComDataCheck:
	NEW!

DListItem:
	Recursion bug fixed with DListItem_move().  Recursion would occur if you moved an item
		at the end of the list to the end of the list.

ErrorLogger:
	Fixed bugs with 'ErrorLogger_log_error()'.
		Removed segment fault when a null ErrorLogger object is passed.
		Now will log the error code.
	Type cast the return value of 'ctime()' to 'const char*' as the Android native compiler threw
		warnings.

time.h:
    NEW!

TimerBase:
    NEW!

Timer:
    NEW!

TimerLight:
    NEW!

TcpClient:
	Modified constructor so that a DNS host can be provided instead of just an IP address. 

zip:
	NEW!
---------------------

----Version 1.0.0 (1/7/2016)----
Technically not the first version, but this is where we are starting to document verions:

All '_private' files have had typedefs removed from the public object declaration because 
older compilers will throw an error because a typedef is defined twice, once in the public 
header file and once in the private header file.

alib_file:
	Modified some return codes to better describe errors.
	Added/fixed comments.

		the library, they are only here for completion.
	Comments updated and corrected.

ArrayList:
	Modified 'delArrayList()' to use 'ArrayList_clear()' to clear the array before deleting
		the object.  Previously used manual logic, only changed for simplicity.	

BinaryBuffer:
    NEW!

ClientListener:
	Polling removed from ClientListener, replaced with 'pthread_cond_wait()'.
	'ClientListener_stop_when_empty()', 'ClientListener_remove()', and

	Renamed from 'event_server'.
		
FdClient:
	Synced comments.	
	
FdServer:
	Modified 'FdServer_stop()' to not join, and added new method called 'FdServer_stop_join()'

		'FdServer_stop()' could be called within the callbacks with no ill effects.
	Updated and synced comments.
	Modified fscb_on_disconnect to have a 'server_cb_rval' return code.
	
flags:
	Updated and synced comments.

	DEPRECIATED!

TcpClient:
	Added 'tc_sockopt' callback to object.  This allows for options to be set for a socket before
		connecting to a host. 	

TcpServer:
	Modified to use EpollPack instead of the localized 'epoll_pack'. 
--------------------------------
