----Version 1.0.0 (1/7/2016)----
Technically not the first version, but this is where we are starting to document verions:

All '_private' files have had typedefs removed from the public object declaration because 
older compilers will throw an error because a typedef is defined twice, once in the public 
header file and once in the private header file.

alib_string:
    Fixed bug with 'strcpy_back()' and 'strncpy_back()'.
    Added 'strncpy_safe()', 'strcpy_safe()', 'memcpy_back()', and 'memcpy_safe()'.
    Added 'str_to_lower()', 'str_to_upper()', 'strn_to_lower()', and 'strn_to_upper()'.

alib_file:
	Modified some return codes to better describe errors.
	Added/fixed comments. 
	
alib_sockets:
	Modified some return codes to better describe errors.
	Added/fixed comments. 

alib_string:
	Modified some return codes to better describe errors.
	Added/fixed comments.
	Modified 'strcpy_alloc()' to simply call 'strncpy_alloc()'. 

alib_types:
	Modified 'is_bool*()' functions to be more robust and have simplier logic, however efficiency
		may not be as high as before.
	Added 'bool' and 'byte' types for completion, however these types should NEVER be used within
		the library, they are only here for completion.
	Comments updated and corrected.

ArrayList:
	Modified 'delArrayList()' to use 'ArrayList_clear()' to clear the array before deleting
		the object.  Previously used manual logic, only changed for simplicity.	

BinaryBuffer:
    NEW!

ClientListener:
	Polling removed from ClientListener, replaced with 'pthread_cond_wait()'.
	'ClientListener_stop_when_empty()', 'ClientListener_remove()', and 
		'ClientListener_remove_socket_package()' added to ClientListener.
	Data_ready and data_in callbacks changed 'data' parameters to be 'void*' instead of 'char*'.		
	Fixed/added comments.
		
DList:
	NEW!
	Designed to replace QueueObject.

DListItem (Previously ListItem):
	NEW!
	Redesigned, but was based off the original ListItem. 
		
EpollPack:
	NEW!
		
ErrorLogger:
	Added several getter and setter functions.
	Modified comments.
	Modified 'el_truncate_ready_cb' and 'el_truncate_cb' to take two arguments, 'ErrorLogger*' 
		and 'size_t'.  This	was needed so that a dynamic maximum file size could be used.
		
event_server/EventServer:
	Renamed from 'event_server'.
		
FdClient:
	Synced comments.	
	
FdServer:
	Modified 'FdServer_stop()' to not join, and added new method called 'FdServer_stop_join()'
		to act similarly to the old 'FdServer_stop()' method.  This was done so that the 
		'FdServer_stop()' could be called within the callbacks with no ill effects.
	Updated and synced comments.
	Modified fscb_on_disconnect to have a 'server_cb_rval' return code.
	
flags:
	Updated and synced comments. 
	
ListHistory:
	Updated and synced comments. 
	
ListHistoryItem:
	Modified 'delListHistoryItem()' to not return a value, would only return a bad argument 
		value.
	Updated and synced comments. 
	
ListItem:
	Modified to be a new base class for list items. 
	
ListItemVal:
	NEW!
	Reference counted object that stores data for ListItem objects.
	Designed to only be freed when it is no longer being refered to by anything else.

MemPool:
	Fixed possible bug with private 'expand()' function ensureing that the capacity can never be 
		expanded past SIZE_MAX.
	Added comments to functions.
	Synced comments. 
	
ProcessThread:
	Removed for being pointless. 

proc_waiter:
	NEW!	

QueueObject:
	REMOVED!  Use DList instead. 

QueueObjectItem:
	REMOVED!  Use DListItem instead.

signal_handler:
	NEW!
	
String:
	NEW!
	Designed to be a more efficient version of StringObject, StringObject is now depreciated.
	
StringObject:
	DEPRECIATED!

TcpClient:
	Added 'tc_sockopt' callback to object.  This allows for options to be set for a socket before
		connecting to a host. 	

TcpServer:
	Modified to use EpollPack instead of the localized 'epoll_pack'.
